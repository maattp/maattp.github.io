## Site Structure

Static personal site with a collection of self-contained web utilities.

Each utility is a single self-contained `index.html` file (HTML + CSS + JS inline).

Update the hamburger menu when adding a new utility.

## Local Development

Preview the site locally:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open http://localhost:8000
