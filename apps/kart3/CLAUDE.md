# Kart 3 — CLAUDE.md

Project notes for **Kart 3** (`apps/kart3/index.html`). Read before changing it.
Repo-root `CLAUDE.md` covers site-wide rules; `apps/kart2/CLAUDE.md` documents
the headless render harness in depth and several lessons this app inherits.

## What this is

A single self-contained `index.html` — a **landscape** (horizontal) 3D kart
racer for iPhone PWA. Three.js **r128** from cdnjs, all assets generated at
runtime. One map ("Coral Cliffs Circuit"), 3 laps, player + **7 AI**.
Left-thumb slide steering, DRIFT/ITEM buttons, auto-accelerate.

## ⚠ Verify by rendering, not by reading

Same rule as Kart 2: for any visual/physics change, run the headless harness
and look at pixels + probe numbers. Pattern (scripts live in `/tmp/kart3dbg/`
during a session; recreate from this recipe):

1. `prep.js` copies `index.html` and injects `window.__dbg = {...}` right
   before `dom.startBtn.addEventListener('click', startGame);` exposing
   scene/camera/karts/track arrays/`netSnapshot`/`aiController`.
2. Launch local Chrome: `--headless=new --use-gl=angle --use-angle=swiftshader
   --enable-unsafe-swiftshader --remote-debugging-port=9223 --user-data-dir=/tmp/...`
3. Drive over CDP from node (global fetch + WebSocket): navigate to the
   `file://` debug copy, `Runtime.evaluate`, `Page.captureScreenshot`.
4. **Autopilot the player** for gameplay tests:
   `p = __dbg.player(); p.ai = {skill:1, aggr:0.6, drift:0.8, driftHold:1.5,
   phase:0, laneBias:0, errT:6, errOff:0, rival:false}; p.controller = __dbg.aiController;`
5. For full-race tests patch `TOTAL_LAPS = 1` in the debug copy.

**SwiftShader caveat:** Lambert + bright lights renders washed-out pastels
headless; the lighting values are kart2-proven on the real iPhone. Force
MeshBasicMaterial to separate real geometry bugs from SwiftShader shading
artifacts. Audio is inaudible in CI — code-review it.

## Architecture (one IIFE)

config → track math → terrain/world build → particles → kart meshes →
race state → physics → items → AI → collisions → camera → HUD/minimap →
audio/music → input → menu → flow → fixed-step sim + render loop → boot.

### Multiplayer-readiness seams (no netcode yet — deliberate)

1. **Seeded PRNG** (`seedRng`/`rng`/`rand`/`pick` = mulberry32). World builds
   from fixed `WORLD_SEED`; each race reseeds from `raceSeed`. Cosmetic
   particle randomness uses `vrand`/`vpick` (Math.random) so it can't desync.
2. **Controllers**: physics reads only `k.ctrl {steer, brake, drift, fire}`.
   `localController` (touch/keys) and `aiController` are interchangeable; a
   future remote peer is just a controller fed from packets. Player item use
   flows through `pendingFire` → `ctrl.fire`, consumed in the sim tick.
3. **Fixed-step sim**: `simTick(SIM_DT=1/60)` via accumulator, numbered ticks
   (`simTickNo`). Everything gameplay-mutable updates there; camera/HUD/audio/
   particles update per render frame.
4. **`netSnapshot()` / `netRestore()`**: full race-state serialization
   (verified exact round-trip in the harness).

The full multiplayer plan (private rooms + matchmaking on the Cloudflare
worker, WebRTC with relay fallback, host-authoritative state sync, voice
stretch goal) lives in **`VISION.md`** — read it before starting any netcode
work, and don't regress these four seams.

### M1 netcode (SHIPPED): rooms + WS relay racing

- `net.mode ∈ solo|host|client`. The worker's `Kart3Room` DO (see
  `worker/CLAUDE.md`) is lobby + opaque relay. Humans fill kart slots in
  roster order, AI fill the rest (`buildKartsRoster`).
- **Host** = full authoritative sim; remote humans drive via
  `remoteController` (latest relayed input; `f` is a cumulative fire counter
  so taps survive packet loss). Snapshots every `SNAP_EVERY` ticks from
  `hostSendSnap` (karts compact-array + box flags + goo/rocket positions).
- **Client** sims ONLY its own kart (prediction) in `netClientFrame`;
  everything else interpolates `INTERP_MS` in the past between buffered
  snapshots (`clientApplySnaps`). Own kart adopts authoritative event/item
  fields (bonk/goo/shield/item/rank/finished) and gets gentle position
  correction (>5u ease, >30u snap). Items/boxes/lap-finishes are
  host-decided on clients; goo/rockets render as pooled "ghost" meshes.
- Disconnected humans convert to AI on the host; host-left ends the race;
  results' RACE AGAIN becomes BACK TO LOBBY (DO phase → lobby).
- No pausing online (pause button hidden, visibilitychange guard).
- **Testing**: `wrangler dev` + `python3 -m http.server 8765` serving the
  debug copy from /tmp (must be http://localhost, NOT file:// — the WS
  route checks Origin) + TWO headless Chrome instances (ports 9223/9224 —
  separate instances, one per player, avoids occluded-tab rAF throttling;
  launch Chrome with `--disable-background-timer-throttling`). Autopilot
  both players and drive the lobby via DOM clicks. The client autopilot
  works because input packets carry `player.ctrl` (controller output), not
  raw touch state.
### M2 netcode (SHIPPED): WebRTC fast path + pose authority + rejoin

- **WebRTC DataChannels** (`rtcInitiate`/`rtcHandleSignal`): host offers one
  unordered/unreliable 'fast' channel per client from the LOBBY (pre-warmed
  before GO); SDP/ICE relayed through the DO (`rtc` messages). Snapshots are
  dual-sent (WS broadcast + every open channel) and clients dedupe by tick —
  fastest transport wins; pairs that can't go P2P just stay on the relay.
  Inputs go rtc-else-ws (`sendToHostFast`). `window.__noRtc` forces relay
  (used in tests).
- **Client-authoritative pose** (fixes M1's stale-steering): input packets
  carry the own-kart pose; on the host, remote karts skip physics entirely
  (`updateRemoteKart`) — pose is lerp-applied, effect timers tick, item
  pickups/laps/ranks stay host-derived, `clampToTrack` sanity-bounds it.
  They're immovable in `resolveCollisions` (owner moves them). The client no
  longer eases toward the host echo (it's just its own delayed pose) — only
  a >45u emergency snap remains. Client rocket-start is back.
- **Mid-race rejoin**: DO stores `seats` (id+name) at race start; a hello
  during `racing` whose name matches a vacant seat is re-admitted with
  `welcome.rejoin`. Host converts that kart AI→remote and sends a targeted
  `rejoin-state` event (seed + racePlayers + full `netSnapshot`). Clients
  auto-retry 4× on mid-race socket loss (own kart keeps driving, remotes
  freeze on the last snap); cold rejoin (page reload) rebuilds the race and
  `netRestore`s.
- **Connection indicator** (`#netInd`): client shows `P2P/RELAY · Nms`
  (WS RTT via `pp` echo, doubles as keepalive); host shows open-channel
  count. Green when fully P2P.
- **CI caveat**: under SwiftShader CPU contention the host page's sim runs
  slower than wall time (hitch guard drops time) while pose-authoritative
  clients keep real-time speed — host AI and raceClock fall behind. That's
  load distortion, not a netcode bug; quiet machines and real phones at
  60fps don't exhibit it. Run perf-sensitive assertions on a quiet machine.

## Track / world model

- **Multi-track**: `TRACKS[]` holds per-track ctrl loops, tunnel/jump
  landmarks, and a `theme` (EVERY world color lives in the theme — sky,
  fog, terrain palette, road/lane, tunnel, foliage kind 'palms'|'spires',
  embers). `loadTrack(idx)` disposes the `world` Group and rebuilds;
  karts/particles/ghosts live in the scene and survive. World build is
  seeded `WORLD_SEED + idx*7919` so every client builds identical tracks.
  Online: host picks in the lobby (`track` DO message); everyone's menu
  backdrop follows live; `start`/`rejoin-state` carry the index. Best
  times are per-track (`kart3_best_<id>`, legacy key = coral).
- Tracks: **Coral Cliffs** (sunny island, beach/palms) and **Volcano Bay**
  (dusk caldera, spires + embers, longer + more technical: S-twist,
  tight descent hairpin).

- `CTRL` points `[x, z, y]` are scaled by `SC = 1.35`; elevation 0→31.
  Tunnel portals + jump location are found by `nearestSeg()` from landmark
  coords at build.
- `centerline/tangents/normals` (N=820): tangents from **finite differences**,
  never `curve.getTangentAt()` (closed-curve seam glitch — kart2's bowtie bug).
- **Banking**: `bankSlope[i]` from smoothed signed curvature; θ increasing
  bends toward −n so outer edge (+n) is higher with the same sign. Road/curbs/
  kart `groundY` all use `roadY(i, lateral)`.
- **Jump**: a 4.6-high wedge carved into the (descending) elevation right at
  `jumpSeg`; vertical physics (`k.y/k.vy/grounded`, launch when ground drops
  faster than `vr < -30`) does the rest. The wedge must out-climb the descent
  or the jump feels flat.
- **Terrain**: 128² heightfield; each vertex blends from road-edge height
  (embankment) to noise hills by distance from the centerline — this is what
  makes elevation possible with no voids (kart2 had to stay flat).
  `terrainY(x, z)` is the same function used for scenery placement.
  **Through the tunnel range the heightfield stays at road level** — the
  headland is a separate rock-shell mesh (bigger arch over the tube + end
  facades connecting shell rim to tube mouth). When the heightfield itself
  ramped up to "cover" the tunnel, the ramp was a solid wall right inside
  the portal mouth (the original "tunnel entrance looks solid" bug).
- **Road decals** (start line, boost pads) are ribbon strips via
  `buildDecalStrip()` that follow `roadY()` bank+slope per sample. Flat
  rotated planes sink/float — the start line vanished into the banked
  chicane (bankSlope at seg 0 is ≈ −0.13).
- Road/curb ribbons are `side: THREE.DoubleSide` (winding faces down).
- Guardrails only where `roadY − terrainY(±(HALF_W+26)) > 4.5` (cliff drops).
- Scenery (palms/rocks/stands/rails-posts/flags…) is baked via `bakeMerge()`
  into ONE vertex-colored mesh (single draw call). Kart bodies likewise: ~45
  primitives baked per kart; wheels are separate meshes (front pivots steer).

## Handling / tuning model (post bug-fix pass)

- Karts have **no lateral slip**: cornering is purely yaw rate vs speed.
  Yaw authority = `TURN_BASE·(1 − TURN_FADE·v/MAX_SPEED)`, so hairpins
  demand braking or drifting (drift turns ~1.2–1.6× tighter).
- `cornerCap[]` is the closed-form solve of `v·κ = margin·yaw(v)` — it MUST
  be derived from the steering model above. (It was once a made-up grip
  formula; the AI braked to ~50 where anyone corners at 90 and "always lost".)
- Acceleration tapers toward the cap (`ACCEL`, `ACCEL_TAPER`): ~4.5s of
  wind-up to top speed, MK64-style.
- **Boosts are one-shot kicks via `grantBoost(k, dur, kick, floor)`** —
  speed += kick (at least floor) once, plus a temporary cap window to
  `BOOST_CAP`. There is deliberately NO per-tick speed floor: the old
  `speed = max(speed, 120)` every tick warped every boost to 120 and made
  chained boost pads a no-op. Pads: +16/0.9s with `padCool` edge-trigger;
  single pad peaks ~124, a chained pair (gap ~118u) lands a second kick to
  the true 138 cap (verified: kicks at both pads, chain peak exactly 138).
- **Fixed-timestep render interpolation (`renderKarts`)**: meshes + camera
  render at the pose blended between the previous and current sim tick by
  `simAcc/SIM_DT`. Without it, 120Hz ProMotion frames alternate 0-and-1 sim
  steps and the kart visibly vibrates against the per-frame-lerping camera
  (ProMotion switches rates adaptively → "sometimes it vibrates"). Camera
  and kart visual lerps are dt-normalized via `frameLerp` for the same
  reason. Mesh sync lives in the render pass, NOT in updateKart.
- AI seek boost pads, drift deliberately into braking corners, and have a
  tight skill band (0.955–1.04) — tune pace via autopilot lap times
  (leader ~22–24s/lap; autopilot avg-skill player should finish mid-pack).

## Gameplay conventions (several are explicit user preferences)

- **No spinouts, ever.** Hits = `bonkKart` (speed cut + hop, steering kept).
  Goo slows + wobbles but never removes control.
- Live standings strip (`#raceStandings`, left edge): all 8 positions at
  ~4Hz; local player gold, remote humans blue-highlighted, 🏁 when
  finished. Friend-finish toasts fire host-side (onLapCrossed) and
  client-side (snapshot finished transition). Results show +gap times.
- Player starts 8th; rank-weighted items (leader pool is defense-only,
  global 30s `zapTimer` cooldown keeps ⚡ rare).
- **Item roulette is tap-to-stop** (player roll 2.2s, AI 1.0s): the first
  `ctrl.fire` while `itemRolling > 0` calls `finishRoll` (locks the item),
  the next one uses it. The item button dedupes `touchstart` + iOS's
  synthetic `click` (one tap must be exactly one fire event, else it stops
  AND instantly uses).
- AI swerve to grab an item box when empty-handed (`b.lat` per box) and
  aim for boost pads.
- Rubber band is bounded (±10%, ±7% on the final lap), two 'rival' AI shadow
  the player, AI block chasers and make late-brake mistakes. AI obey the same
  physics caps as the player (`_rubber` is the only asymmetry).
- **Settings pane** (start screen ⚙): steering direction Standard/Reversed
  (flips TOUCH steering only — arrow keys stay absolute; base mapping was
  empirically verified correct via NDC-projection probe: thumb-right moves
  the kart screen-right initially before the chase camera re-centers it)
  and steering sensitivity (thumb travel 36-110px). Persisted as
  kart3_steerrev / kart3_sens.
- Drift only engages while actually steering (|steer| > 0.28); hold DRIFT on
  GO! for a rocket start.
- Lap counting: forward seam crossing (prev seg > 0.7N → new seg < 0.25N);
  grid starts just *past* the line.

## Verification checklist before shipping

1. `node -e "new Function(<inline script>)"` syntax check.
2. Headless: menu + free-camera shots (top-down, start line, banked bend,
   tunnel, jump) + autopilot race with screenshots; capture `Runtime.exceptionThrown`.
3. Full 1-lap race → results screen, 8 standings rows, race-again works.
4. Jump probe: player goes airborne (grounded=false) near `jumpSeg` with a
   rising arc.
5. Honest PR notes: no GPU, no audio, no touch in CI.
